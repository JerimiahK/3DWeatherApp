# 3D Weather App

## Description
This weather application is an attempt to build a React weather application, that uses Three.js, React Three Fiber, React Three Drei, Tailwind CSS, and Headless UI to build a unique, interactive 3D weather application. The purpose of this is to allow me the opportunity to experiment with new, creative libraries, and provide users with a fun way to get the weather. 

## Usage
This application is still under development, and a better description of usage will be provided in the future when development has a more clear end picture.
